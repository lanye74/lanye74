Hello, I'm Layne!

I'm primarily a frontend web dev; currently working on my second full-stack project, `urealms-wiki`, built in SvelteKit.
 
- I write SvelteKit applications in HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. I'm familiar with Rust, but no expert
	- I intend to learn a stylesheet language, like Sass
- Very comfortable with `node.js`, but some day I'd love to learn `Deno` or `Bun`
	- Historically, I've used the `electron` and `discord.js` packages a bunch, but it's been a while
- Familiar with databasing, particularly with Supabase
- Have networking experience with Extreme and Avaya switches
